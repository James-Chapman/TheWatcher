# Changelog

All notable changes to TheWatcher are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Added the six-role access model: `global_admin`, `global_operator`,
  `global_viewer`, `group_admin`, `group_operator`, and `group_viewer`.
  Global roles can see all agents, alerts, views, and users according to their
  write permissions; group roles are scoped to their assigned groups.
- Added group-scoped views. View create/edit now accepts `group_id`, and
  non-global users only see views owned by or assigned to their visible groups.
- Added per-agent heartbeat configuration to the dashboard Configure modal,
  API, persisted agent record, and `CONFIG_UPDATE` payload. Valid values are
  1 through 60 seconds, with a default of 5 seconds.
- Added per-agent markdown runbooks to the agent Configure modal and alert
  payloads so alerts can show host-specific response guidance.
- Added IP address display on Monitoring, Agents, and Pending Enrollment rows.
  The agent id remains visible on Agents and Pending Enrollment rows.
- Added Windows network collector support through IP Helper APIs.

### Changed
- Moved approved-agent group assignment into the agent Configure modal.
- Operators can configure maintenance windows for agents they can operate.
- Alerts, agents, and views are filtered by group membership for non-global
  users. Moving an agent between groups moves its alert visibility with it.
- User and group management now follows the new role model: global admins can
  manage users and groups, global/group operators have read-only user access,
  and group admins can create users only inside their own groups.
- Legacy global runbook create/delete endpoints now require `global_admin`
  because those runbooks are consumed globally by alert generation.
- Linux and BSD foreground agents now respond to `Ctrl+C` while waiting for
  enrollment retry loops.

### Removed
- Removed the agent temperature collector from the build and dashboard health
  model. Historical temperature metric fields remain in the wire schema for
  backward compatibility.

### Removed
- **Bazel/Bazelisk build system removed.** Meson + Ninja is now the sole
  supported build path on Windows, Linux, and BSD. Deleted `BUILD.bazel`,
  `MODULE.bazel(.lock)`, `WORKSPACE.bazel`, `.bazelrc`, `.bazelignore`,
  every per-package `BUILD.bazel`, `scripts/bazel.cmd`, `build.cmd`, the
  Bazel-only `patches/` and `third_party/` directories, and the Bazel
  documentation. `scripts/setup-build-env.ps1` no longer installs Bazelisk
  or writes `.bazelrc.user`; the Windows quick start now goes through
  `meson-build.cmd`, and binaries land in `builddir-release/{server,agent}/`
  instead of `bazel-bin/`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Runbook links** (Issue #11): a `RunbookRecord` maps `(indicator, status)`
  pairs to a URL and optional notes. A wildcard indicator `"*"` matches any
  indicator when no exact match exists. Runbooks are stored in a new `runbooks`
  table (SQLite and PostgreSQL). When an alert fires, `StatusEngine` looks up a
  matching runbook and embeds the URL in the `AlertRecord`; the URL is also
  included in the webhook payload. New API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/runbooks` — list all runbooks (viewer+)
  - `POST /api/runbooks` — create a runbook (`{indicator, status, url, notes}`; admin only)
  - `DELETE /api/runbooks/:id` — delete a runbook (admin only)
  The dashboard gains a **Runbooks** management tab (admin only) and alert rows
  link to the runbook URL when one is present.
- **PostgreSQL backend** (Issue #12): `PostgresStore` is a full implementation
  of the `Store` interface using libpq (the PostgreSQL C client library).
  Enabled at build time when `libpq` is found by Meson; the
  `HAVE_LIBPQ` preprocessor flag gates all PostgreSQL code. Activate by
  setting `db_type = "postgres"` and `postgres_dsn = "..."` in the server
  config. The schema uses `BIGSERIAL`, `BOOLEAN`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, and
  `BYTEA` PostgreSQL types; BYTEA is stored as `\x`-prefixed hex strings in
  text mode. `make_store()` routes the connection automatically.
  A dedicated `store_postgres_test` test executable covers agent CRUD,
  metrics, alerts, runbooks, settings, sessions, maintenance windows, and
  silence rules against a live PostgreSQL database.
- **HA topology documentation** (`docs/ha-topology.md`): reference
  two-server active/standby setup with pgBouncer connection pooling and
  keepalived VRRP for virtual-IP failover.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- **Anomaly detection** (Issue #6): when `multiplier > 0` is set in the
  collector config for CPU, memory, disk, or network, the status engine
  computes a rolling baseline mean from historical metrics and flags the
  indicator Yellow if the current sample exceeds `mean × multiplier`. A
  5-minute in-process cache avoids recomputing on every reading. Config is
  stored as two new CBOR fields (`cpu_anomaly`, `memory_anomaly`) on
  `CollectorConfig` and per-disk/network entries, with backward-compatible
  size checks so old agents receive old configs without errors. The
  dashboard collector-config editor exposes the multiplier and baseline
  window fields.
- **Scheduled fleet digest reports** (Issue #7): a report scheduler sends
  a JSON health digest to a configured webhook URL on a daily or weekly
  cadence (UTC hour, optional day-of-week). The digest includes agent
  totals, online/offline/maintenance counts, alert counts by severity, and
  the top-5 agents ranked by oldest unacknowledged alert.
  `GET/PUT /api/settings` gains `reports_enabled`, `reports_schedule`,
  `reports_hour`, `reports_day_of_week`, and `reports_webhook_url` fields.
  `POST /api/reports/send` triggers an immediate digest (admin only). The
  Settings page gains a Scheduled Reports section.
- **Stale metrics detection** (Issue #8): when `stale_after_seconds > 0`
  in the collector config, the status engine tracks the last observed value
  per agent/indicator; if it remains unchanged beyond the window (epsilon
  0.01) the indicator is raised to at least Yellow. The staleness clock
  resets automatically when the value next changes. Defaults to 0
  (disabled). Carried as CBOR element 12 in the 13-element
  `CollectorConfig` array with a backward-compatible decode guard.
- **Log file tailing and alerting** (Issue #9): agents can now watch log
  files with regex patterns and forward matched lines to the server as
  `LOG_MATCH` frames (new frame type `0x09`). `LogMonitorConfig`
  `{path, pattern, indicator_name, severity, enabled}` is added to
  `CollectorConfig` (CBOR element 13). `LogCollector` polls files each
  collection cycle, tracks file position and inode for rotation detection,
  and matches lines with `std::regex`. The server inserts matches into a
  `log_matches` table and raises an alert on the named indicator (silence
  rules respected). `GET /api/agents/:id/log-matches?limit=N` returns the
  match history. The dashboard gains a Log Watches config section and a Log
  Matches history card in the agent detail panel.
- **Custom dashboard views** (Issue #10): operators can create named views
  that show a chosen subset of agents. Views can be public (visible to all
  users) or private (owner only). `GET/POST /api/views` and
  `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/views/:id` manage views; the dashboard adds a Views
  tab with bookmarkable `#view-{id}` URLs so the monitoring panel can be
  filtered to a specific view.

### Fixed
- **LogCollector incremental tailing**: after `std::getline` exhausts a
  file it sets `eofbit`, causing the subsequent `tellg()` to return `-1`.
  The collector now calls `file.clear()` before `tellg()` and falls back to
  `st_size` if the position is still negative. Previously every incremental
  tick after the first silently re-read from offset `-1`, causing repeated
  duplicate matches.
- **Integration test enrollment re-check**: the agent lifecycle scenario
  re-sent a ZMQ enrollment request immediately after HTTP approval, which
  was blocked by the 10-second per-agent rate limiter. Replaced with an
  HTTP-API approval check; the subsequent CURVE handshake proves key
  exchange.

### Tests
- **BDD store coverage** (12 new scenarios, 62 new assertions): inclusive
  `get_metrics_in_window` boundaries, session expiry edge cases
  (`expires_at > now_ms`), agent deletion cascades, silence rule expiry at
  exact boundary, `approve_agent` clearing a rejected flag, and several
  other state-transition edge cases.
- **BDD status engine coverage** (9 new scenarios): `classify_percent`
  exact thresholds (80/90/95), direct green→red CPU jump, process-scope
  isolation, `process_readings=1` immediate red, maintenance exit
  behaviour, NaN→grey, anomaly firing and suppression (< 10 baseline
  samples), stale metric detection.
- **New test suite — LogCollector** (`agent_tests/log_collector_test.cpp`,
  11 scenarios / 29 assertions): empty config, missing file, empty file,
  pattern match/no-match, `take_matches` drain, incremental tailing,
  file-rotation detection, disabled config, invalid regex, stale-state
  pruning via `set_configs`.
- **Integration tests — API coverage** (6 new scenarios / 83 new
  assertions): user management (create/disable/enable/password change/
  delete), group management (create/list/validation), views CRUD with
  public/private visibility rules, alert listing and bulk operations,
  session and login API, enrollment rejection and per-agent config APIs
  (description, thresholds, uptime, log-matches, agent deletion).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- **Alert silencing**: operators can create silence rules scoped to an agent
  and/or indicator with an expiry time; silenced transitions do not generate
  alerts.
- **Metrics retention**: configurable retention period (default 30 days) prunes
  old metric rows automatically; configurable via the settings API.
- **Status history viewer**: `GET /api/agents/:id/history` returns the
  per-indicator transition log; surfaced in the dashboard alongside each agent.
- **Bulk alert operations**: `POST /api/alerts/bulk-ack` and
  `POST /api/alerts/bulk-archive` let operators acknowledge or archive multiple
  alerts in a single request.
- **Maintenance windows**: scheduled maintenance windows (with optional wildcard
  agent matching) automatically put agents into maintenance mode and resume them
  when the window ends; manageable via the settings panel.

### Security
- Enrollment channel: public key is now locked after first approval — subsequent
  re-enrollments from the same agent ID cannot replace an approved key (prevents
  identity hijacking via the unauthenticated enrollment socket).
- Enrollment channel: per-agent-ID rate limit of one request per 10 seconds.
- Enrollment channel: z85 public key format validated (exactly 40 chars, z85
  alphabet) before storage; malformed keys are rejected.
- Login endpoint: rate-limited to 5 failures per username; account locked for
  15 minutes on breach, with `HTTP 429` + `Retry-After: 900` response.
- Command IDs: replaced truncated 32-bit millisecond timestamps with
  8-byte cryptographically random hex values (via libsodium) to eliminate
  collision risk.
- Command dispatch: `command_type` validated against the known `CommandType`
  enum; `args` payload capped at 4096 bytes.
- Dispatched command map: entries are evicted after a 5-minute TTL to prevent
  unbounded memory growth when agents drop without ACKing.
- Webhook SSRF: loopback (`127.x`, `::1`, `localhost`), RFC-1918 (`10.x`,
  `172.16–31.x`, `192.168.x`), and link-local (`169.254.x`) hosts are blocked
  in the webhook URL validator.
- Session cookie: `Secure` flag added to both login and logout `Set-Cookie`
  headers.
- Input length caps on all user-supplied string fields stored to the database
  (username ≤ 64, password ≤ 256, note/description ≤ 4096, reason ≤ 1024,
  group name 1–64); over-length inputs return `HTTP 400`.
- Metrics history `limit` query parameter capped server-side at 1000.
- `column_exists()` validates table/column identifiers against `[a-z_]` before
  SQL string concatenation.
- Agent config file (`TheWatcherAgent.conf`) permissions set to `0600` on POSIX
  after every write, protecting the embedded CURVE secret key.
- All mutating API endpoints check `Content-Type: application/json`; requests
  with a mismatched type return `HTTP 415`.
- `gethostname()` / `GetComputerNameA()` return values checked; falls back to
  `"unknown"` on failure.
- Login form no longer pre-fills the default admin username.
- Added code comments documenting the ZAP NULL-mechanism allowance rationale
  and the plain-HTTP deployment requirement for the REST API.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- `meson-build.cmd` now configures, builds, and tests the static Meson release
  build in `builddir-release`.
- Ignored the generated release Meson build directory for Git and Bazel package
  discovery.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- Meson now builds libzmq and libsodium as local static subprojects from
  source archives. The Meson build no longer requires vcpkg, pkg-config, or
  system ZeroMQ/libsodium packages.
- Updated the Meson helper script to configure static local dependency builds
  and reconfigure an existing build directory without vcpkg assumptions.
- Kept Bazel aligned with the same static ZeroMQ/libsodium model by preserving
  archive-backed libzmq, libsodium, and cppzmq wrappers for Windows, Linux, and
  BSD builds.

### Fixed
- Patched libzmq's sodium detection for parent-supplied libsodium include and
  library paths so Meson and Bazel can both build CURVE-enabled static ZeroMQ
  without external package manager metadata.
- Ignored generated Meson build and subproject extraction directories from
  Bazel package discovery so local Meson smoke builds do not break
  `bazel test //...`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- Kept ZeroMQ on the static Bazel path and removed vcpkg project hooks from the
  Windows/Meson helper flow. `build.cmd` now relies on the archive-backed static
  `libzmq` build with libsodium/CURVE support.
- `common/crypto.hpp` now owns Z85 encode/decode for Curve25519 keys instead of
  calling ZeroMQ's C helper functions. Config/protocol-only targets can link
  shared crypto code without forcing a ZeroMQ build.

### Added
- Added BDD coverage for the local Z85 encode/decode path and invalid key
  rejection.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- Replaced MessagePack with libcbor 0.13.0 for every ZeroMQ wire frame
  (Frame, EnrollRequest, EnrollResponse, CommandMessage, AckMessage,
  SetIntervalArgs, SetProcessLimitArgs, ConfigUpdate, SystemMetrics,
  CollectorConfig). The agent and server now exchange CBOR exclusively;
  the `msgpack-cxx` dependency is gone.
- Replaced JSON config files with KEY=VALUE format. Agent config moved from
  `agent.json` to `TheWatcherAgent.conf`; server config from `server.json`
  to `TheWatcherServer.conf`. Comments use `#`. The legacy JSON load path
  in the agent has been removed; existing 0.2.x JSON configs must be
  re-generated by deleting the old file and letting the agent recreate it.
- SQLite metrics column changed from `metrics_json TEXT` to
  `metrics_cbor BLOB`. The server stores the original CBOR payload from
  the agent verbatim; the REST API decodes CBOR → SystemMetrics → JSON
  for the dashboard so the API shape is unchanged. Existing 0.2.x
  databases auto-migrate by dropping and recreating the metrics table on
  first start (historical metrics are lost; agents will repopulate).
- Wire `to_cbor`/`from_cbor` are now templates with `template<>`
  specialisations (matching the `from_cbor` pattern that already worked).
  This removes a two-phase qualified-name-lookup gotcha that the previous
  overload set hit when called via `pack<T>()`.
- libcbor's `cbor_get_uint64()` reads 8 raw bytes regardless of the stored
  width; we wrap it in a width-aware `cbor_uint_value()` helper. Without
  this, decoding any small uint8/16/32 returned garbage adjacent memory.

### Added
- Meson build system added side-by-side with Bazel. Top-level `meson.build`,
  per-component `meson.build` files (common, agent, agent/collectors,
  server, common_tests, agent_tests, server_tests, integration_tests).
  Subprojects: catch2, sqlite3, nlohmann_json, cpp-httplib, libcbor,
  cppzmq, libzmq, and libsodium. See docs/build-environment.md.
- New `server/api_json.hpp` provides nlohmann adapters for the metric
  structs so the REST API can keep emitting JSON without dragging
  nlohmann into `common/`.

### Fixed
- libcbor Bazel BUILD now lists every C source the library depends on (the
  previous list was missing `internal/builder_callbacks.c`,
  `internal/encoders.c`, `internal/loaders.c`, `internal/memory_utils.c`,
  `internal/stack.c`, `internal/unicode.c`).
- `third_party/libcbor/generated/cbor/configuration.h` now defines
  `CBOR_MAX_STACK_SIZE` (was missing; broke compilation of `internal/stack.c`).
- Windows include order across collectors and agent/server config files —
  `<windows.h>` must precede `<sysinfoapi.h>`, `<shlobj.h>`, `<psapi.h>`,
  `<sddl.h>`, `<tlhelp32.h>` to set up the architecture macros that
  `<winnt.h>` depends on.
- `to_cbor_vector` / `config_to_cbor_vector` template definitions reordered
  to come AFTER the per-struct `to_cbor` specialisations they dispatch to.

### Removed
- `nlohmann/json.hpp` is no longer included by `common/metrics.hpp`,
  `agent/config.hpp`, `agent/config.cpp`, `server/config.hpp`,
  `server/config.cpp`, or `server/server.cpp`. nlohmann remains in
  `common/collector_config.hpp` (REST round-trip) and `server/api*` (REST
  output) only.

## [0.2.29] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added persisted per-agent collector configuration for absolute CPU/memory
  thresholds, per-fixed-disk thresholds, per-interface network Mbps thresholds,
  process watches, and per-collector consecutive-reading counts.
- Added an Agents Configure modal that replaces inline threshold controls and
  sends the full collector config to the server.

### Changed
- Status evaluation now uses absolute collector thresholds instead of
  percentage-of-average settings.
- Process monitoring now checks exact executable names and expected counts,
  escalating missing processes across consecutive failed readings.

## [0.2.28] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Changed Monitoring alert notifications to render each alert as a separate
  severity-themed item using the known hostname with the agent id as secondary
  text.

### Fixed
- Fixed the Monitoring table heading so it no longer floats over row values
  when alert notifications are visible.

## [0.2.27] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added per-agent CPU, memory, disk, and network warning/degraded/critical
  percentage thresholds with API and Agent Management controls.
- Added hostname-plus-agent-id alert display so Alerts matches the Monitoring,
  Agent Management, and Pending Enrollment identity presentation.

### Changed
- Status evaluation now uses per-agent threshold overrides before falling back
  to global threshold settings, while retaining the absolute 70/85/95 caps.

## [0.2.26] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added the server CURVE public key and a pinned BLAKE2b-256 fingerprint to
  approved enrollment responses.
- Added agent-side server key pinning so agents persist the approved server key
  fingerprint and reject later enrollment approvals from a different server key.

### Changed
- Agents can now learn the server public key during approval, removing the need
  to pre-populate `SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY` for normal first enrollment.

## [0.2.25] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Reintroduced the dashboard heartbeat indicator as the final Monitoring dot.
- Added agent metric collection summaries, outgoing frame send diagnostics, and
  server-side inbound metric/heartbeat receive summaries.

### Changed
- Renamed the dashboard Overview page to Monitoring in the operator UI and
  documentation.

## [0.2.24] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Changed SingleLog file flushing so trace, debug, and info entries flush every
  100 file log lines while notice, warning, error, and critical entries flush
  immediately.

## [0.2.23] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added grouped Overview rendering so approved agents are listed under their
  assigned group names, with an Overview group filter and an Ungrouped section.
- Added collector-level trace/debug logging for CPU, memory, disk, network,
  process, and temperature collection updates.
- Added BDD coverage for Overview grouping/filtering and live SingleLog file
  flushing.

### Changed
- SingleLog now periodically flushes file output so agent log files show
  INFO/DEBUG/TRACE records while the agent is still running.

## [0.2.22] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Fixed an API route lifetime bug where callbacks captured stack-local helper
  lambdas from route setup, causing the server-agent integration test to crash
  with SIGSEGV on authenticated routes after login.

## [0.2.21] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Raised Bazel C++ compiler warnings to the highest configured warning level:
  `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` for Linux, macOS, and BSD builds and `/Wall` for
  MSVC.

## [0.2.20] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Updated the server-agent integration test to authenticate through
  `/api/login`, persist the returned session cookie, and query pending
  enrollments through `/api/pending-enrollments`.
- Removed the workspace root `tmp` directory created during local server
  debugging because it collides with a `rules_foreign_cc` generated file named
  `tmp` during Windows Bazel builds.

### Documentation
- Documented the Windows Bazel failure mode caused by a root-level `tmp`
  directory.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added persistent operations schema for groups, users, sessions, agent-group
  membership, status history, alerts, and server settings.
- Added SQLite-backed login with the default admin account
  `thewatcher` / `look_at_me`, libsodium password hashing, and HTTP-only
  session cookies.
- Added approved-agent and pending-enrollment API separation, admin approval
  with group assignment, and RBAC gates for viewer/operator/admin actions.
- Added status transition evaluation with five-minute-average thresholds,
  worsening-only alert generation, alert acknowledgement, alert soft delete,
  and maintenance alert clearing.
- Added dashboard login, pending enrollments, alerts, users/groups, status,
  alert dot, no-data grey, amber degraded, and maintenance blue workflows.
- Added an Inno Setup Windows EXE installer script for installing server and
  agent binaries under `C:\Program Files\TheWatcher`.
- Added BDD coverage for operations persistence and status/alert transitions.

### Changed
- Split Bazel persistence/status tests away from the full server library so
  store and status engine tests do not pull the ZeroMQ build path.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Resolved relative server SQLite `db_path` values beside the active server
  config file so enrolled agents persist across restarts launched from
  different working directories.

### Added
- Added a dev-task-planner implementation plan for alert history, pending
  enrollments, RBAC, authentication, dashboard workflow changes, and Windows
  EXE installers.
- Added BDD coverage for server config database path resolution.

## [0.2.17] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- Converted project logging call sites to use `SingleLog.hpp` `LOG_` and
  `LOGF_` macros instead of direct logging function calls.
- Configured `SingleLog` directly from each binary entry point instead of using
  a project wrapper.

### Added
- Added detailed debug and trace logging around server startup, enrollment,
  API agent actions, command dispatch, ZAP decisions, SQLite store mutations,
  agent enrollment, config loading, and service control paths.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added component prerequisite requirements to the installation documentation.
- Added nginx and Apache httpd examples for publishing the dashboard on Linux
  and BSD, including production static hosting and development-only Vite
  reverse proxy setups.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added complete operator documentation for installation, configuration,
  running, service operation, logging, and dashboard use.
- Added architecture and development documentation covering every major
  component and the end-to-end workflow for adding collectors.

### Changed
- Reworked the README into a documentation index and quick-start guide.
- Expanded existing build, dashboard, logging, service, and collector docs to
  match the current server and agent behavior.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added `TheWatcherAgent.conf` support with `THEWATCHER_SERVER=<host>` for
  deriving agent data and enrollment endpoints.
- Added agent-originated config refresh requests after metrics submissions.
- Added server-side offline detection using configurable
  `offline_after_seconds`.

### Changed
- Persisted per-agent collection interval and process limit settings so config
  refresh responses can return current server-side settings.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added a persisted maintenance state for agents so pause and resume
  acknowledgements are reflected in the dashboard.
- Added a row-level Resume action for agents that are already in maintenance.

### Changed
- Hid approve and reject controls once enrollment has been decided, leaving
  deletion as the way to start enrollment again.

### Fixed
- Fixed the agent management table header and row layout so the heading bar no
  longer overlaps the row content.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added an end-to-end server-agent integration test that exercises enrollment,
  API approval, CURVE connection, real collector metrics, API-visible server
  storage, disconnect, and shutdown.
- Added server-observed agent connection state to `/api/agents`.

### Fixed
- Sent the agent disconnect ACK immediately before stopping the agent IO loop so
  the server can record the disconnect.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- Added dashboard agent management for approving, rejecting, configuring, and
  deleting enrolled agents.
- Added persistent rejected enrollment state so rejected agents receive an
  enrollment rejection instead of remaining pending.
- Added dashboard API helpers and tests for agent management actions.

### Fixed
- Corrected pending enrollment responses so unapproved agents keep polling
  instead of treating a pending response as approved.

### Changed
- Renamed Bazel executable targets to `//server:TheWatcherServer` and
  `//agent:TheWatcherAgent`.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Enabled ZeroMQ CURVE support in the Windows libzmq build by patching sodium
  detection for Bazel-provided libsodium.
- Rebuilt the documented `//server:server` target as `server.exe` so the
  command-line server path is no longer stale.
- Added foreground startup signaling so server worker-thread failures are
  reported before printing the running message.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Added a common `SingleLog` wrapper and wired server, agent, API, ZAP, and
  Windows service runtime diagnostics through it.
- Added logging documentation covering default log locations, levels, and
  service-mode behavior.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Added the React, TypeScript, and Vite dashboard implementation using the
  supplied dark infrastructure table sample as the visual direction.
- Added dashboard health mapping, summary counts, expandable detail rows, API
  polling, and Vitest coverage for status behavior.
- Added shared Windows service helpers and wired server/agent flags for
  `--service`, `--install-service`, `--uninstall-service`, and
  `--service-name`.
- Added dashboard and service installation documentation.

### Changed
- Foreground mode remains the default for server and agent binaries.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Added the workspace-local `bazel-help-root` verification output directory to
  `.bazelignore` so `bazel test //...` does not scan generated Bazel install
  files as source packages.
- Documented the local output-root troubleshooting case.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Added `scripts/bazel.cmd` as the supported Windows Bazel launcher so
  `BAZEL_SH` is set before the Bazel server chooses its shell executable.

### Changed
- The setup script now persists `BAZEL_SH` in the user environment.
- Updated build documentation to use `scripts/bazel.cmd` for Windows builds.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Added `scripts/setup-build-env.cmd` as an execution-policy-safe launcher for
  the PowerShell build environment setup script.

### Changed
- Updated setup documentation to use the `.cmd` wrapper by default.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Added Git Bash `BAZEL_SH` and `PATH` settings to Bazel host action
  environments so `rules_foreign_cc` exec-tool builds do not fall back to the
  WSL `bash.exe` launcher.
- Updated the build environment script to write the host action settings and
  restart the Bazel server after changing `.bazelrc.user`.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- Added `scripts/setup-build-env.ps1` to install/check Windows build tools,
  configure Bazel's Git Bash environment, and optionally provision WSL Linux
  build dependencies with Bazelisk.
- Added build environment documentation covering requirements, setup, build
  steps, WSL verification, and troubleshooting.

### Fixed
- Ensured Bazel Windows actions prefer Git Bash before the WSL `bash.exe`
  launcher in `PATH`.
- Changed the Windows libsodium version-header genrule to use `cmd.exe` instead
  of Bash so it does not fail when WSL has no installed distro.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Moved straightforward third-party dependencies to Bzlmod registry modules:
  Catch2, cpp-httplib, and SQLite.
- Updated `bazel_skylib` to the selected registry version used by transitive
  dependencies.
- Updated Catch2 tests to use the BCR module's `catch2_main` target and modular
  Catch2 v3 headers.

### Fixed
- Added a Bazel 9 compatibility patch for the BCR cpp-httplib module's
  `cc_library` load.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- Added Bazel 9 / Windows build fixes for `rules_foreign_cc`, Git Bash shell
  selection, and libsodium's in-place autotools configuration.
- Added a native Windows libsodium Bazel target and corrected libzmq's Windows
  static-library output name.
- Configured msgpack-cxx to use bundled predef headers instead of requiring
  Boost for endian detection.
- Included the protocol helpers in `server/api.cpp` and fixed command argument
  packing to use the declared `proto::pack` helper.
- Fixed `get_os_version()` so the Windows path does not instantiate POSIX
  `utsname`, and added BDD coverage for a non-empty OS version string.
- Defined `ZMQ_STATIC` and Windows socket link libraries in the cppzmq Bazel
  wrapper so tests link against the static libzmq build.
- Replaced Unix-style Windows `-l...` link options with MSVC `*.lib` names and
  linked `shell32.lib` from `agent_lib` for the agent config path helper.
- Linked `shell32.lib` from `server_lib` for the server config path helper.
- Aligned the agent collector contract around `Collector::name()` and
  `Collector::update(SystemMetrics&)`.
- Removed stale `collect()` / `getRates()` collector declarations and
  placeholder collector namespaces that did not match `agent/agent.cpp`.
- Updated CPU, disk, and network collectors to populate `SystemMetrics`
  directly instead of returning ad-hoc metric maps.
- Hardened process collector state tracking by adding the missing internal
  `cpu_percent` field used for top-process sorting.
- Updated `agent/agent.cpp` to use `std::make_unique` for collector ownership
  and safe `dynamic_cast` checks before changing process collector limits.

### Added
- BDD-style collector contract test covering polymorphic `name()` and
  `update(SystemMetrics&)` behavior.
- Collector contract documentation in `docs/collector-contract.md`.
- Bazel build notes in `docs/bazel-build.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `server/server.hpp` / `server/server.cpp` — main `Server` class orchestrating
  the ZMQ ROUTER socket (metrics/commands data plane), enrollment REP socket,
  ZAP auth handler, REST API, and SQLite storage backend.
- `server/main.cpp` — server entry point with signal handling (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`),
  config loading, `--genkey` helper, and background thread management.
- `server/BUILD.bazel` — Bazel build rules; splits server into a `cc_library`
  (`server_lib`) and a `cc_binary` (`server`) so tests can link the library.
- `common_tests/protocol_test.cpp` — BDD-style tests for Frame round-trip
  encoding, EnrollRequest/Response payloads, CommandMessage, SystemMetrics
  nested serialization, and FrameType enum stability.
- `server_tests/store_test.cpp` — BDD-style tests covering all SQLite store
  operations: agent CRUD, upsert idempotency, approval, deletion, metrics
  insertion, limit queries, and `latest_metrics` per-agent aggregation.
- `server_tests/zap_handler_test.cpp` — BDD-style tests for ZAP key-set
  management: add, remove, duplicate add, harmless remove-of-absent key.
- Googletest `1.14.0` added to `MODULE.bazel` for test infrastructure.

### Fixed
- `server/api.cpp` — all four `CommandMessage::command_id` assignments were
  incorrectly casting `uint32_t` to `std::string`; replaced with
  `std::to_string(...)`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Initial implementation by prior LLM pass:
  - `common/` — `metrics.hpp`, `protocol.hpp`, `commands.hpp`, `crypto.hpp`
  - `agent/` — `Agent` class with three `std::jthread` loops (IO, collection,
    heartbeat), six platform-aware metric collectors (CPU, memory, disk,
    network, process, temperature), config persistence, and enrollment client.
  - `server/` (partial) — REST API (`api.hpp/cpp`), SQLite store
    (`store_sqlite.hpp/cpp`), ZAP handler (`zap_handler.hpp/cpp`), server
    config (`config.hpp/cpp`), abstract `Store` interface (`store.hpp`).
  - Bazel build system: `MODULE.bazel`, `.bazelrc`, third-party BUILD stubs
    for libzmq, libsodium, cppzmq, msgpack-cxx, cpp-httplib, sqlite3.

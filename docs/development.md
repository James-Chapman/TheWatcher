```

## Coding Standards

- C++ code is C++20.
- Format C++ with the repository `.clang-format`.
- Keep top-level C++ namespace as `thewatcher`.
- Prefer structured types in `common/metrics.hpp`, `common/protocol.hpp`, and
  `common/commands.hpp` over ad hoc strings.
- Use BDD-style tests with `GIVEN`, `WHEN`, and `THEN`.
- Add tests before behavior changes.
- Update docs for every behavior or workflow change.
- Bump the `version` in `meson.build` and update `CHANGELOG.md` for each
  change set.
- Meson builds ZeroMQ and libsodium as local static subprojects from
  `subprojects/*.wrap` plus `subprojects/packagefiles/`; do not add vcpkg,
  pkg-config, or system package assumptions for these dependencies.
- Keep persistence/status tests on the lighter `server_store_lib` target when
  they do not need ZeroMQ. Use `server_lib` only for tests that exercise the
  full server runtime.
- Keep `httplib` route callbacks self-contained. Shared authorization,
  session, and command helpers should live on `ApiServer` and callbacks should
  capture `this` or values, not references to stack-local helper lambdas from
  route setup.

## Adding A New Collector End To End

Use this checklist when adding a metric family such as GPU, filesystem inode
usage, services, packages, or custom application health.

1. Define the metric shape in `common/metrics.hpp`.

   Add a struct with stable field names and a
   `NLOHMANN_DEFINE_TYPE_NON_INTRUSIVE` mapping. Add the struct to
   `SystemMetrics`.

2. Add wire/API compatibility tests.

   Update or add tests that serialize and inspect `SystemMetrics`. If the new
   metric affects integration behavior, extend
   `integration_tests/server_agent_integration_test.cpp`.

3. Implement the collector.

   Add `agent/collectors/<name>_collector.hpp` and `.cpp`. Inherit from
   `thewatcher::agent::Collector` and implement:

   ```cpp
   std::string_view name() const noexcept;
   void update(SystemMetrics& metrics);
   ```

   Keep platform-specific code behind preprocessor guards. The agent should
   still compile on Windows, Linux, and BSD.

4. Register the collector with Meson.

   Update `agent/collectors/meson.build` with the new source and header so
   the static `agent_collectors` library picks them up.

5. Add the collector to the agent runtime.

   Register it in `Agent::Agent()` in `agent/agent.cpp`. If it needs runtime
   settings, add those settings to `common/collector_config.hpp`,
   `common/commands.hpp`, `server/store.hpp`, `server/store_sqlite.cpp`,
   `server/api.cpp`, `dashboard/src/models.ts`, and the Agents Configure
   modal. `ConfigUpdate` is the agent-facing carrier for these settings.

6. Update dashboard models and status mapping.

   Update `dashboard/src/models.ts` for the API shape, `dashboard/src/status.ts`
   for health classification, and `dashboard/src/main.tsx` if the UI needs new
   controls or columns. Collector thresholds should be absolute values in the
   same units the collector reports: percentages for CPU, memory, and disks;
   combined megabits per second for network interfaces; exact executable counts
   for process watches.
   If the new collector becomes an alerting indicator, also update
   `server/status_engine.cpp` and `server_tests/status_engine_test.cpp`.

7. Add tests.

   Add focused collector tests in `agent_tests/` or extend
   `collector_contract_test.cpp`. Add dashboard tests when health classification
   changes. Extend integration tests when the new metric must be proven through
   the server API.

8. Update docs.

   Update [Collector Contract](collector-contract.md), [Architecture](architecture.md),
   [Dashboard](dashboard.md), and `CHANGELOG.md`.

9. Run verification.

   ```powershell
   clang-format -i <changed-cpp-files>
   meson test -C builddir-release collector_contract_test server_agent_integration_test --print-errorlogs
   cd dashboard
   npm.cmd run build
   npm.cmd test
   ```

## Adding A New Server Command

1. Add the command enum and payload struct in `common/commands.hpp`.
2. Add an API route in `server/api.cpp` that validates input and queues a
   `CommandMessage`.
3. Handle the command in `Agent::handle_command()` in `agent/agent.cpp`.
4. If the command changes persistent state, update `server/store.hpp`,
   `server/store_sqlite.cpp`, the dashboard model, and API tests.
5. Add BDD tests and update docs.

## Adding A New REST API Field

1. Add the persistent or computed field in the server model.
2. Serialize it in `agent_to_json()` or metric JSON.
3. Update `dashboard/src/models.ts`.
4. Update `dashboard/src/status.ts` or `dashboard/src/main.tsx` if displayed.
5. Run dashboard build/tests and relevant server tests.

## Third-Party Dependencies

Prefer WrapDB-tracked Meson wraps when they preserve behavior. Keep custom
packagefile overlays only where the project needs custom build settings
(currently libsodium and libzmq, both built with CURVE-enabled static linkage)
or the dependency is not available in WrapDB.

Current dependencies pulled in via `subprojects/*.wrap`:

- `libzmq` (with `subprojects/packagefiles/libzmq` overlay)
- `libsodium` (with `subprojects/packagefiles/libsodium` overlay)
- `libcbor` (with `subprojects/packagefiles/libcbor` overlay providing
  pre-generated headers)
- `cppzmq`, `sqlite3`, `nlohmann_json`, `cpp-httplib`, `catch2-with-main`
  (WrapDB).

## Release Checklist

1. Add or update BDD tests.
2. Implement the change.
3. Run focused tests.
4. Run relevant integration tests.
5. Format C++ code.
6. Update docs.
7. Bump the `version` in `meson.build`.
8. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.
9. Run final build/test commands for changed components.

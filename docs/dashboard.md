# Dashboard

The dashboard is a React + TypeScript + Vite app under `dashboard/`.

## Role

The dashboard is the operator UI. It talks only to the server REST API; it does
not connect to agents.

Current capabilities:

- login/logout with SQLite-backed sessions;
- monitoring view of agent health and latest metrics;
- approved-agent-only monitoring;
- pending enrollment approval/rejection with group assignment;
- hostname-based alert notifications and alert acknowledgement/delete workflow;
- user and group creation for admins;
- per-agent collector configuration for poll interval, process limit, CPU,
  memory, disk, network, process watches, and consecutive-reading counts;
- pause/resume maintenance mode;
- restart collectors;
- request immediate status;
- delete stale or rejected agent records.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd dashboard
npm.cmd install
```

Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

Vite serves the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:5173` and proxies `/api` to
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Build

```powershell
cd dashboard
npm.cmd run build
```

The production bundle is written to `dashboard/dist/`. The C++ server does not
serve this bundle yet. Host it separately for production use.

## Tests

```powershell
cd dashboard
npm.cmd test
```

The current tests cover health thresholds, alert display enrichment,
worst-status summary counts, missing-metrics behavior, maintenance state, agent
management API calls, and admin user/group API calls.

## Views

### Monitoring

The Monitoring view shows approved agents only. It joins `/api/agents`,
`/api/metrics`, and `/api/alerts/unacknowledged` by `agent_id`.

Approved agents are grouped by their assigned group names. Administrators see
all approved agents they can access, with each group rendered as a section
heading above its agents. Agents that belong to multiple groups appear in each
matching group section. Agents without an assigned or visible group appear in
the `Ungrouped` section.

The group filter can show all groups, a single group, or only ungrouped agents.

Columns:

```text
Server | Uptime | Status | Alerts | CPU | Memory | Disk | Network | Temp | Proc | Heartbeat
```

The top counters are:

```text
Healthy | Warning | Degraded | Critical | Maintenance | Offline
```

Status priority is red, amber, yellow, grey, then green. A host with no data is
shown as yellow in the derived Status column while its missing component dots
are grey. Maintenance turns all component dots blue.

The Heartbeat dot is the final component dot. It is green when the server still
considers the agent connected, grey when the agent is offline or has never sent
a heartbeat, and blue during maintenance.

Unacknowledged alerts appear between the top counters and the Monitoring table.
Each alert is rendered as its own severity-themed item using the known hostname
as primary text and the agent id as smaller secondary text.

### Agents

The Agents view manages approved agents only:

- approved agents have a Configure button beside the agent identity;
- the Configure modal updates poll interval, process sample limit, CPU and
  memory absolute percentage thresholds, fixed disk thresholds, network
  interface Mbps thresholds, process watches, and consecutive-reading counts;
- disk rows are shown by mount point/path with device name in brackets;
- network thresholds are combined receive plus transmit megabits per second per
  selected interface;
- process watches use exact executable names plus an expected process count;
- approved agents can enter or leave maintenance mode with a stored reason and
  optional expiry timestamp;
- approved agents can restart collectors, request status, or disconnect;
- any agent row can be deleted.

### Pending Enrollments

The Pending Enrollments view is admin-only. It shows unapproved agents awaiting
approval. Approving an agent accepts a list of group ids; rejecting an agent
marks enrollment rejected. Approved/rejected buttons disappear from approved
agent management because decided enrollments are no longer pending. Pending
rows show the hostname as primary text and the agent id as smaller secondary
text.

### Alerts

The Alerts view lists active, non-deleted alerts. Operators and admins can
acknowledge alerts or soft-delete them. The Monitoring alert dot is green unless
the host has an unacknowledged alert, in which case it is red. Monitoring alert
notifications and Alert rows show the known hostname as primary text and the
agent id as smaller secondary text.

### Users & Groups

The Users & Groups view is admin-only. It lists users, roles, groups, and state.
Admins can create groups and create users with `viewer`, `operator`, or `admin`
roles and an initial group assignment.

## API Contract

The dashboard consumes:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |

| `POST /api/logout` | Delete the current session. |
| `GET /api/session` | Return the current authenticated session. |
| `GET /api/agents` | Approved agent identity, connection, maintenance, settings, groups, and timestamps. |
| `GET /api/pending-enrollments` | Pending enrollment records for admins. |
| `GET /api/metrics` | Latest metrics snapshot per agent. |
| `GET /api/groups` | List groups. |
| `POST /api/groups` | Create a group. |
| `GET /api/users` | List users and group memberships. |
| `POST /api/users` | Create a user with hashed password, role, and group memberships. |
| `GET /api/alerts` | List active, non-deleted alerts. |

| `POST /api/agents/:id/reject` | Reject pending enrollment. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/groups` | Replace an approved agent's group memberships. |
| `DELETE /api/agents/:id` | Delete agent and metrics. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/set_interval` | Legacy endpoint for poll interval update. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/set_process_limit` | Legacy endpoint for process limit update. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/thresholds` | Legacy endpoint for old threshold rows. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/collector_config` | Persist collection interval, process limit, and full collector configuration. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/maintenance` | Enter maintenance with optional reason and expiry. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/pause` | Queue maintenance pause. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/resume` | Queue maintenance resume. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/restart_collectors` | Queue collector restart. |
| `POST /api/agents/:id/get_status` | Queue immediate metrics report. |

Agent rows include:

```text
agent_id
hostname
platform
curve_public_key_z85
approved
rejected
connected
maintenance
maintenance_reason
maintenance_until
collection_interval
process_limit
collector_config
thresholds
first_seen
last_seen
group_ids
```

Metric rows include:

```text
agent_id
timestamp_ms
metrics
```

`metrics` is the JSON form of `common/metrics.hpp::SystemMetrics`.

## State Rules

- Pending agents receive `approved=false` until an operator approves them.
- Approved enrollment responses include the server public key and pinned
  fingerprint the agent persists before connecting to the data socket.
- Rejected agents receive an enrollment rejection on the next attempt.
- CPU and memory use absolute per-agent percentage thresholds. Defaults are
  warning 80, degraded 90, critical 95.
- Disk checks are per fixed disk. Empty disk config means monitor all reported
  fixed disks with default thresholds.
- Network checks are per selected interface using combined receive plus transmit
  megabits per second. Defaults are warning 100, degraded 200, critical 300.
- Process checks use exact executable names and expected counts. Fewer running
  instances than expected escalates yellow, amber, then red across configured
  consecutive failed readings.
- Worsening numeric collector transitions are committed only after the
  configured number of consecutive readings. Recovery resets pending counts.
- `connected` becomes true after inbound agent traffic.
- `connected` becomes false after successful disconnect ACK or after
  `offline_after_seconds` with no inbound frame.
- `maintenance` becomes true from the maintenance action or pause ACK.
- `maintenance` becomes false after successful resume ACK.
- Maintenance suppresses and clears active alerts for that host.
- Worsening indicator transitions create alerts. Recoveries are history-only.
- Alert delete is a soft delete; alert history remains in SQLite.
- Runtime settings are persisted on the server and returned to agents after
  each metrics submission via config refresh.

## Changing Dashboard Data

When server API fields change:

1. Update `dashboard/src/models.ts`.
2. Update `dashboard/src/status.ts` if health or grouping changes.
3. Update `dashboard/src/main.tsx` if rendering or controls change.
4. Add/update Vitest coverage.
5. Run `npm.cmd run build` and `npm.cmd test`.
